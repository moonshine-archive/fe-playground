# things that flow

We focus on user experience by adopting smooth movement as a core principle of every interaction. We believe and are obsessed with the idea that every moment a user engages with our product should be smooth. Under smooth interactions, our end goal is to have beautiful, colorful graphics waiting at the end of the user's minimal gesture.

We practice different technology stacks, build and automate our development environment and infrastructure to achieve all of this, and we try to go beyond simple implementation to stay ahead of technology trends.
